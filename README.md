# Strava Inspired App

## Specific React Technologies Used

- React Context
- Custom Hooks

## Usage

- you must have the track server that accompanies this repo to run it (ask it from Nicole!)
- you will need to run the server and source the baseURL from an ngrok tunnel you will be generaating so you can send requests from it if you're running this app on a physical device
- to run this app, install dependencies using both expo-install and npm install
- and of course, run the app with this script `npm start`
